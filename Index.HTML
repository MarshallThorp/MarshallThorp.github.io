        <p id="today">Today we had a snow day and one of my favorite musical artists came out with a new song that is included in their album that is being released sometime this year. A movie that I have been waiting to be relaeased was released today. I spent the day in my room doing nothing (like everyday). By doing nothing I mean watching Youtbe and spending time on my phone.

        <p id="was">Today was a boring day and I spent it in my room watching Youtube, Netflix and Disney+. I usually do nothing. But today, when my family was going to the store they got stuck in the snow by our driveway. I needed to go out and help them get unstuck and I ended up slipping on ice and fell. When I fell, I scraped my knee and it startes to bleed.
